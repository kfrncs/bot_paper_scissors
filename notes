TODO:

rename columns to fit p1, p2
drop game_round from training df & dummy



1 = rock
2 = paper
3 = scissors
0 = no input

MUST:

be built in flask
show wins/losses
use an ML algorithm
prove it's not peeking

STRATEGY:

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gvym4x/game-theory-rock-paper-scissors

humans tend to repeat their successful strategies 

losers try to change their tactics

statistically scissors wins on first move the most (maybe max knows this??? make the bot check)

1: if opponent plays rock and wins (against scissors), he's more likely to play rock again. 
    so prefer to play the unplayed option (paper)

2: mirror. if bot wins, play the opponent's move

declare what you are going to play and tell the truth.
  -> maybe randomize? or take into account what max did when we did this
